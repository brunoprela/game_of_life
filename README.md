## Game of Life

A Conway's game of life simulator in which you can:
	* pick from cool preset grid patterns and see how they develop
	* create your own grid patterns and see how they develop
	* start/pause the runtime of the grid at any moment
	* make cells alive or dead at any moment (whether running or paused)

This project presents a pretty cool look at how to separate concerns in a more complex JS project, and it also is very fun to play with. To test it out, simply clone this repo and open **index.html** in a browser.
